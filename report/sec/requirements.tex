\chapter{Requirements}
The functional and non-functional requirements are often used in software engineering to specify functions and how the system operates respectively. 

The functional requirement more concretely should define what a system should accomplish. They are descriptive and should be written in such a way the reader immediately understands why the requirement is in place and how it pertains to the system.

The non-functional requirement should resemble the functional requirement in readability, however they instead specify how a system should be. This includes: security, usability and maintainability among others.
