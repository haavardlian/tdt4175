\chapter{Possible problems with the new solution}
One of the biggest weaknesses with our suggested changes, is that it has more of a single point of failure than the current system. With the changes we propose, it would be impossible for NTNU-students to register for courses if the system is down. The same goes for other parts of our system, but it is more important for the functionality today governed by Student Web, since there are set deadlines for every student in Norway. That is, if the Student Web suffer system failure, then it would affect all users equally. With the changes, there is a possiblity that only NTNU students are affected, and would be punished for it. 

A second problem is that a system like this, would not be trivial to maintain. It is quite possible that NTNU would be unable to run such a system. This is because they would have to hire people to design, program and maintain it. Since it is not part of our task to determine if implementing the changes outlined in this report, we will neglect this point. However,  we feel, that with an unlimited budget, our system would be better than the current one. More servers is also needed, because of the increased server load on the main system.
