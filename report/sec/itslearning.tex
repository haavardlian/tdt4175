\subsection{It's Learning}
While Innsida is the main site for NTNU, It’s Learning main platform for students on a day-to-day basis. This is where all the information regarding courses they take are such as assignments, lecture slides, curriculum and last student assistant hours. This system also  where students deliver the assignments, receives feedback and grading on said assignments. 

It’s Learning is a system created by an external company, and is used widely as an teaching-platform among both high schools, universities and other higher educational institutes throughout the world. 

Since It’s Learning is a bought LMS, NTNU has very little say in the design and customization of the system. This has led many lecturers to creating their own systems, and using those instead. Example of this is most math-courses and TDT4120 (Algorithms and Datastructures).
