\chapter{Conclusion}

In this report we have proposed a new information system that we think would greatly improve the day to day life of students and employees at NTNU. The feutures of the new system is based on observations we have made as users of the current systems over many years as students and to some lesser extend teaching assistants.

The changes proposed in the new system are quite radical and will largely change how students and employees access their information.
